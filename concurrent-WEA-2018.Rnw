\begin{abstract}
Concurrent languages such as Perl 6 fully leverage the power of
current multi-core and hyper-threaded computer architectures, and they
include easy ways of automatically parallelizing code. However, to
achieve more computational capability by using all threads and cores,
algorithms need to be redesigned to be run in a concurrent
environment; in particular, the use of a reactive, fully functional
patterns need to turn the algorithm into a series of stateless steps, with simple functions
that receive all the context and map it to the next stage. In this paper, we
are going to analyze different versions of these stateless, reactive
architectures applied to evolutionary algorithms, assessing how they
interact with the characteristics of the evolutionary algorithm itself
and show how they improve the scaling behavior and performance. We will use the
Perl 6 language, which is a modern, concurrent language that was
released recently and is still under very active development.

\section{Introduction}

\noindent Evolutionary algorithms (EA) \cite{GA_Goldberg89} are currently
one of the most widely used meta-heuristics to solve optimization
problems in engineering. If the cost or adequacy of a solution can be
measured in terms of a single function, called {\em fitness},
evolutionary algorithms are generally able to find a good solution
given enough time. 
Furthermore, parallel and distributed evolutionary algorithms (pEAs) are useful
to find  solutions of problems with a time-consuming fitness function
\cite{Luque2011,merelo2018cloudy,gong2015distributed}
% Was not very clear - M
% Are they complex mostly in terms of running time or space?
% In the next paragraph we talk about 'evaluation time'
or problems that need many evaluations to find a good solution; in
either case, using several computing {\em nodes} speeds ups the
algorithm; even some
authors \cite{Alba2001,Jini:Paralelos,evag:gpem} state that using pEAs improves the quality of
solutions in terms of the number of evaluations needed to find
one. This reason, together with the improvement in evaluation time
brought by running simultaneously in several nodes, have made
parallel and distributed evolutionary algorithms a popular
methodology.

One of the reasons for this popularity is that the implementation of
EAs in parallel is relatively straightforward, by just dividing the
population into computing nodes and using some messaging mechanism to
interchange some members selected according to some optimality
criterion \cite{DBLP:conf/gecco/AraujoGMC09}
but programming paradigms used for the implementation of such
algorithms are far from being an object of study in the wide
evolutionary algorithm area; object oriented or
procedural languages like Java and C/C++ are mostly used. Even when
some researchers show that implementation matters
\cite{DBLP:conf/iwann/MereloRACML11}, parallel approaches found in new
languages/paradigms are not usually pursued; this is what we intend to
do in this paper.

The main reason for doing this is that, despite having identified new
parallel platforms as a challenge in EAs \cite{Luque2011}, in general,
only advances in hardware are considered. Software platforms,
specifically programming languages, remain poorly explored; only Ada
\cite{Santos2002}, Scala \cite{krzywicki2015massively} and Erlang
\cite{A.Bienz2011,Kerdprasop2013,Stypka2018,butcher2018actor} have
been analyzed in the area of evolutionary computation. Even so, the
number of works on this area has increased lately, since the challenge
of multi-core, hyper-threaded architectures \cite{SutterL05} need
better applications, even simpler ones, to be
parallelized. Eventually, this  shows the need use and
create design patterns for concurrent algorithms; the conversion of a pattern
into a language feature is a common practice in the programming languages domain,
and sometimes that means a language modification, others the creation
of a new one. 


That is the case of Perl6
\cite{Tang:2007:PRI:1190216.1190218}, a relatively new and decidedly
non mainstream language (since it is not included in the top ten of
any of the most popular languages rankings), with concurrent and functional
features in order to develop parallel versions of EAs through
concurrency. Perl 6 started as a redesign of the implementation of
Perl, given its inadequacy to work correctly, among other things, with
threads. Perl 6 has a three-tier architecture, including a virtual
machine (either MoarVM, specifically designed for Perl 6, JVM or,
lately, GraalVM \cite{wurthinger2013one}; a second level with a
minimal bootstrapping language called NQP (Not Quite Perl), which
allows for easy portability among different VMs, and finally a
compiler, of which there is just one version right now, called Rakudo.
This paper, as well as similar ones preceding it
 \cite{DBLP:conf/gecco/CruzGGC13,Albert-Cruz2014169,Merelo:2018:MEA:3205651.3208317}, are
motivated by the need to explore new language architectures that give
you good insight on the nature of evolutionary algorithms, as well as
the need to create fast implementations that can be run efficiently in
current processor architectures.

This research is intended to show some possible areas of improvement
on architecture and engineering best practices for concurrent-functional paradigms,
as was made for Object Oriented Programming languages \cite{EO:FEA2000},
by focusing on pEAs as a domain of application and describing how their principal
traits can be modeled by means of concurrent-functional languages constructs.
We are continuing the research reported in
\cite{DBLP:conf/gecco/CruzGGC13,J.Albert-Cruz2013}. This paper is an
extended version of \cite{Merelo:2018:MEA:3205651.3208317}, including
new results with an updated version of the evolutionary algorithm library.

Previously
\cite{Merelo:2018:MEA:3205651.3208317,Garcia-Valdez:2018:MEA:3205651.3205719},
we explored stateless evolutionary algorithm architectures. In this
paper we will also see how to work with implicit parallelism at the
instruction level, what kind of changes are needed to make it work and
the speedups that can be achieved in that case.


The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Next section presents the state
of the art in concurrent and functional programming language  in the
area of parallel evolutionary algorithms. We present two different versions
of a concurrent evolutionary algorithm in Section \ref{sec:impl},
to be followed by actual results in section \ref{sec:res}. Finally, we draw the
conclusions and present future lines of work in section \ref{sec:conclusions}.

\section{State of the Art}

\noindent Despite the emphasis on hardware-based techniques such as
cloud computing or GPGPU, there are not many papers dealing with
creating concurrent evolutionary algorithms that work in a single
computing node.

The concurrent programming paradigm (or concurrency oriented
programming \cite{Armstrong2003}) is characterized by the presence of
programming constructs for managing processes like first class
objects. That is, with operators for acting upon them and the
possibility of using them like parameters or function's result
values. This changes the coding of concurrent algorithms due to the
direct mapping between patterns of communications and processes with
language expressions; on one hand it becomes simpler since the
language provides an abstraction for communication, in the other hand
it changes the paradigm for implementing algorithms, since these new
communication constructs have to be taken into account.

This design has to take into account the communication/synchronization
between processes, which nowadays will be mainly threads. One of the best efforts to formalize
and simplify that is the Hoare’s {\em Communicating Sequential
  Processes} \cite{Hoare:1978:CSP:359576.359585}, this interaction
description language is the theoretical support for many libraries and
new programming languages. This kind of concurrent programs is based
on {\em channels}, which are used to interchange message between the
different processes or threads; messages can be interchanged
asynchronously or synchronously. The Go language uses this kind of
model, and Perl 6 will use, among others (like {\em promises} or
low-level access to the creation of threads), this one.
Another, different, approach is actor-based
concurrency, \cite{schippers2009towards}. This actor model bans shared
state, with different {\em actors} communicating through messages \cite{erb2012concurrent}. 


The fact that messages have to be processed without secondary effects
and that actors do not share any kind of state makes concurrent
programming specially fit for functional languages or languages with
functional features; this has made this paradigm specially popular for
late cloud computing implementations; however, its presence in the EA
world is not so widespread, although some efforts have lately revived
the interest for this kind of paradigm \cite{swan2015research}. Several years ago was used in Genetic Programming
\cite{Briggs:2008:FGP:1375341.1375345,Huelsbergen:1996:TSE:1595536.1595579,walsh:1999:AFSFESIHLP}
and recently in neuroevolution \cite{Sher2013} but in EA its presence,
despite being scarce in the previous years
\cite{Hawkins:2001:GFG:872017.872197}, has experimented a certain rise
lately with papers such as \cite{valkov2018synthesis} which perform
program synthesis using functional programming or
\cite{barwell2017using} which uses the functional and parallel
language Erlang for an evolutionary multi-agent system.

Among languages with functional features, the languages Erlang and Scala have
embraced the actor model of concurrency and get excellent results in
many application domains; Clojure is another one with concurrent
features such as promises/futures, Software Transaction Memory and
agents; Kotlin \cite{simson2017open} has been recently used for
implementing a functional evolutionary algorithm framework.  

On the
other hand, Perl 6 \cite{Tang:2007:PRI:1190215.1190218} uses different
concurrency models, that go from implicit concurrency using a
particular function that automatically parallelizes operations on
iterable data structures, to explicit concurrency using threads. These
both types of concurrency will be analyzed in this paper, which uses
the {\tt Algorithm::Evolutionary::Simple} library for that language
which was presented in the same conference \cite{DBLP:conf/gecco/GuervosV18}

\section{Concurrent evolutionary algorithms and its implementation}
\label{sec:impl}

The implementation of evolutionary algorithms in a concurrent
environment must have several features:\begin{itemize}
\item They must be {\em reactive}, that is, functions respond to
  events, and not procedural or sequential.
\item Functions responding to events are also first class objects and
  are stateless, having no secondary effects. These functions have to
  be reentrant, that is, with the capability of being run in a thread
  without exclusion of other functions.
\item Functions communicate with each other exclusively via channels, which can
  hold objects of any kind but are not cached or buffered. Channels
  can be shared, but every object can be read from a channel only
  once.
\end{itemize}

In general, an evolutionary algorithm consists of an iterative
procedure where, after generating an initial set of individuals, these
individuals are evaluated, and then they reproduce, with errors and
combination of their features, with a probability
that is proportional to their fitness. As long as there is variation
and survival of the fittest, an evolutionary algorithm will
work. However, the  usual way of doing this is through a series of
nested loops, with possibly asynchronous operation in a parallel
context when communicating with other {\em islands} or isolated
populations. However, the concept of loop itself implies state, in the
shape of the generation counter, or even with the population itself
that is handled from one iteration step to the next one.

Getting rid of these states, however, leads to many different
algorithms which are not functionally equivalent to the canonical
genetic algorithm above. Of course, a functional equivalent is also
possible in this environment, with non-terminating {\em islands}
running every one of them on a different thread, and communicating via
channels. Although this version is guaranteed to succeed, we are
looking for different implementations that, while keeping the spirit
of the evolutionary algorithm, maps themselves better to a
multithreaded architecture and a concurrent language such as Go, Scala
or Perl 6.

This is why in this paper we are going to examine two different
architectures, which basically differ in the granularity with which
they perform the evolutionary algorithm.

%
% \begin{figure*}[h!tbp]
% \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{channels-individual.png}
% \caption{Channels and functions used in the individual-level concurrency version of the algorithm. }
% \label{fig:indi}
% \end{figure*}

% \subsection{Individual-level concurrency}
% \label{ss:indi}

% In this version of the algorithm, all functions operate on single individuals or sets of them. We are going to use three different channels:\begin{itemize}
% \item Channel {\sf individual}, which contains chromosomes without a fitness
%   function. A subchannel of this channel takes the chromosomes in groups.
% \item Channel {\sf evaluated}, which contains chromosomes paired with
%   their fitness function. This channel receives individuals one by
%   one, but emits them in groups of three.
% \item Channel {\sf output}, which is used for logging what is
%   happening in the other two channels and printing output at the end
%   of the experiment.
% \end{itemize}

% There are two functions feeding these channels. \begin{itemize}

% \item {\sf Evaluator} reacts to the {\sf individual} channel, picking and evaluating a single individual and emits it to the {\sf evaluated} as
%   well as {\sf output} channel as an object that contains the original chromosome and the computed fitness.
% \item {\sf Reproducer} picks three individuals from the {\sf
%     evaluated} channel, generates a new couple using crossover, and
%   emits it to the {\sf individual} channel. This function also acts as
%   selector, and in fact it is similar to 3 tournament, since it takes three individuals and returns only two of them to the channel, along with the two individuals that have been generated via crossover and mutation.
% \item {\sf Diversifier} is a re-broadcasting of the {\sf individual
%     channel}, picks a group of individuals and shuffles it, putting it
%   back into the same channel, giving them a different order in the
%   buffer.
% \end{itemize}

% How channels and functions relate to and communicate with each other is represented in Figure \ref{fig:indi}.  The functions described above rebroadcast the values they read from the channel when needed to other channels so that all
% channels are kept fed and a deadlock situation is not produced. This
% could happen, for instance, if the {\sf reproducer channel}, which
% takes individuals in pairs, is only able to read a single one; since it is waiting for
% a second individual it is not producing new ones and the algorithm
% will stall. This could be fixed in a different way by changing from a reactive architecture to a {\em polling} architecture, but that kind of architecture also introduces overhead by polling when it is not needed. You have to balance when designing these types of algorithms, anyway; polling is another possibility, but one we are not exploring in this paper.

% The concurrency of this situation implies that we can run as many
% copies as available of every one of them. Also that there is an
% initial process where you generate the initial population, a series of
% individuals which must be even, and bigger than the number of
% individuals used in the diversifier. This is equivalent to an initial
% population, although in this case there is no real {\em population},
% since individuals are considered in groups of several, depending on
% the tournament size.

% Depending on the overhead communication adds, it is possible
% that the performance of this version of the algorithm is not the adequate one, even if
% theoretically it is sound. That is why we have also proposed next a
% coarse-grained version where the function process whole populations.

% \subsection{Population-level concurrency}
% %
% % \begin{figure*}[h!tbp]
% % \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{population-channel.png}
% % \caption{Channel and functions used in the population-level concurrency version of the algorithm. }
% % \label{fig:pop}
% % \end{figure*}
% %
% In this case, the algorithm uses a single channel that emits and
% receives, as messages, whole
% populations. However, this channel is also re-broadcast as another channel
% that takes the population in pairs. Having a single channel, even is with
% different threads, will make several threads concurrently process
% populations that will evolve in complete independence. This is why
% there are two functions: \begin{itemize}
% \item {\sf Singles} takes single populations and evolves them for a
%   number of generations. It stops if it finds the solution, and closes
%   the channel at the same time.
% \item {\sf Pairs} reads pairs of populations from the sub-channel and
%   mixes them, creating a new population with the best members of both
%   populations. This {\em mixer} is equivalent to a process of
%   migration that takes members from one population to another. Since
%   this function takes two elements from the channel, it must leave two
%   elements in the channel too. What it does is it emits back a
%   randomly chosen population in the pair.
% \end{itemize}

% Additionally, there must be a function, which can be concurrent, to
% create the initial population. The process of migration performed by
% the mixer is needed to overcome the {\em stateless}
% nature of the concurrent process. The state is totally contained in
% the population; the mixer respects this state of affairs by using only
% this information to perform the evolutionary algorithm.

% This algorithm has several parameters to tune:\begin{itemize}
% \item {\bf Number of generations} that every function runs. This
%   parameter is equivalent to the time needed to perform some kind of
%   migration, since it is the time after which populations are sent
%   back to the channel for mixing and further evolution.
% \item {\bf initial populations} The channel must never be empty, so
%   some initial random populations must be generated, always in pairs.
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Notes on implementation using Perl 6}

% Perl 6 \cite{Tang:2007:PRI:1190215.1190218} has been chosen to perform
% the implementation of these two different versions of a concurrent
% evolutionary algorithm. This choice has been due mainly to the
% existence of an open source evolutionary algorithm library, recently
% released by the authors and called {\tt
%   Algorithm::Evolutionary::Simple}. This library, released to the
% repository of Perl 6 modules, called CPAN, includes
% functions for the implementation of a very simple evolutionary
% algorithm for optimizing onemax, Royal Road or any other benchmark
% function.

% Perl 6 \cite{lenzperl} is, despite its name, a language that is
% completely different from Perl, designed for scratch to implement most
% modern language features: meta-object protocols, concurrency, and
% functional programming. It does not have a formal grammar, but is
% rather defined by the tests a compiler or interpreter must pass in
% order to be called ``Perl 6''.
% Current implementation consists of a virtual machine with just in
% time capabilities, called MoarVM, and a compiler (Rakudo) which is written mostly in Perl 6 itself, so that it can
% be easily ported from one virtual machine to others; the rest is written in a simple language called NQP (Not Quite Perl). All together they compose the so-called {\em Rakudo
%   star} distribution, a {\em stable} distribution of compiler +
% virtual machine that is released every 4 months from GitHub and to
% package repositories. Right now the Java Virtual Machine is a few features behind MoarVM, and there is a new virtual machine in the works which is based on JavaScript.

% The advantage of using Perl 6 for this work is that it combines the expressivity of
% an interpreted language with the power of concurrency. Not very many
% languages nowadays include concurrency as a base feature; Go, Scala
% and Erlang are some of them. % add references - JJ
% The concurrency in Go is done in a
% similar way to Perl 6, using channels, but Go is a compiled,
% non-functional language. % What about the others? - JJ

% The main disadvantage of Perl 6 is currently its raw performance, which is much
% slower than Go or Java, although in general, similar although slower than
% other interpreted languages such as Python or Perl; it has also
% improved a lot in the last versions \cite{DBLP:conf/gecco/GuervosV18}. Language
% performance is not an static feature, and it usually improves with
% time; in a separate paper, we have proved how speed has increased by
% orders of magnitude since it was released a few years ago. % Cite the other paper - JJ

% This paper, however, is focused on the algorithmic performance more
% than the raw performance, so suffice it to say that Perl 6 performance
% was adequate for running these experiments in a reasonable amount of
% time.

The module used, as well as the code for the experiments, is available
under a free license.

\section{Experimental setup and results}
\label{sec:res}

The first experiments we have performed for this paper included using
implicit autothreading, in the shape of the method called {\tt race}
or {\tt hyper}. These methods auto-thread the processing of arrays or
list, disregarding the order in the first case, using it in the second
case. In order to check this we implemented the p-peaks function
\cite{kennedy1998matching}, which was considered more adequate for
this task since it is, at the same time, deceptive from the point of
view of the evolutionary algorithm and computing-intensive, involving
computing the distance to a number of generated binary strings, which
in this case were 100.

In order to do this implicitly parallel version, several changes had
to be made to the function that evaluates the whole
population: \begin{itemize}
\item First, the cache had to be turned off. We were using a cache to
  keep all values that were already computed, and we had to stop using
  it. Since it is autothreaded, trying to store or retrieve from the
  cache simultaneously could result in deadlocks or crashes. 
\item Do all the computation in a functional way, without side
  effects. The auto-threaded code must take values, return values,
  without changing any external variable on the fly. All values are
  then computed and assigned to the data structure that holds them.
\end{itemize}

Perl 6, by default, uses 4 threads for auto-threading. We designed
population evaluation so that it was autothreaded, and did some
runtime tests. Without changing the algorithm, this resulted in an
almost 4x speedup of the original code. 

This implies that using implicitly parallel facilities might allow,
without much changes to the underlying algorithm, to use
multithreading and achieve speedups, as already observed in
\cite{DBLP:conf/gecco/GuervosV18}. However, it is essential that what
is being parallelized is a substantial amount of work. Using just
MaxOnes, as in the above mentioned paper, will not offer any
substantial speedups and might even result in performance taking a
hit.


However, we were more interested in creating explicit concurrent
version of the evolutionary algorithm, and do a set of experiments to
make them work properly. In the next set of experiments we will
concentrate not so much in runtime performance, but on algorithmic
performance, that is, the number of evaluations needed to find the
solution.

\end{figure*}
%
In order to perform the experiments, we used Linux boxes (with Ubuntu
14.04 and 16.04), the latest version of the Perl 6 compiler and
virtual machine. First we used a selecto-recombinative evolutionary
algorithm, with no mutation, in order to find out what's the correct
population for every problem size \cite{lobo2005review}. This method
sizes populations looking for the minimal size that achieves a 95\%
success rate on a particular problem and problem size; in this case,
size 512 was the ideal for the MaxOnes problem with size 64. This size
was used as a base for the rest of the problem sizes; since the real
evolutionary algorithm actually uses mutation, the population was
halved for the actual experiments. This population size is more
dependent on the problem itself than on the particular implementation,
that is why we use it for all implementations.

\end{figure}
%
First we run a basic evolutionary algorithm with different chromosome
sizes, to get a baseline of the number of evaluations needed for
finding the solution in that case. Time needed was the main requisite
for choosing the different sizes, although we think that scaling
should follow more or less the same trend as shown for smaller
sizes. We compared mainly the number of evaluations needed, since that
is the main measure of the quality of the algorithm.

We show in Figure \ref{fig:evals:mo} the logarithmic chart  of the
number of evaluations needed to find the solution for different, logarithmically
growing, chromosome sizes using the individually concurrent
evolutionary algorithm. There is a logical increase in the number of
evaluations needed, but the fact that it is a low number and its
scaling prove that this simple concurrent implementation is indeed an
evolutionary algorithm, and does not get stuck in diversity traps that
take it to local minimum. The number of evaluations is, in fact, quite
stable.

We did the same for the population-level concurrent algorithm;
however, since this one has got parameters to tune, we had to find a
good result. In order to do that, we tested different number of
initial populations placed in the channel, since this seems to be the
critical parameter, more than the number of generations until
mixing. The results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:pop:initial}. The
difference between using 4 and 6 initial populations is virtually
none, but there is a slight advantage if you use only 2 initial
populations to kickstart the channel. Please bear in mind that, in
this case, the concept of {\em population} is slightly different from
the one used in island EAs. While in the latter the population does
not move from the island, in this case populations are read from
channels and acted upon, and in principle there could be as many
initial or unread populations as wanted or needed; every function in
every thread will process a single population nonetheless. 

We can now compare these two algorithms with the baseline EA. This is
a canonical evolutionary algorithm using bitflip mutation and
two-point crossover, using roulette wheel as a selection method. It
has, as the rest of the implementations of the algorithms, been
implemented using {\tt Algorithm::Evolutionary::Simple}, the free
software module in Perl 6.

The comparison is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:comparison}, which shows, in a logarithmic $y$ scale, a
boxplot of the number of evaluations for the baseline, as well as the
two different concurrent algorithms, at the population and individual
level. As it can be seen, this last algorithm outperforms the other
two, achieving the same result using many less evaluations, almost one
order of magnitude less. In fact, both concurrent algorithms are
better than the baseline, and please note this measures the number of
evaluations, equivalent to the algorithmic complexity, and not
time. This figure is the base to reach our conclusions.

\section{Conclusions and discussion}
\label{sec:conclusions}

It is natural to take advantage of the multi-threading and multi-process
capabilities of modern hardware architectures to make evolutionary or other
population-based algorithms run faster by using all CPUs and threads
at the same time; that can be done in a very
straightforward way by parallelizing the evolutionary algorithm using
the many available models, such as island model; however, it is
possible that adapting the algorithm itself to the architecture makes
its performance better, by actually adapting the resources consumed to
the resources used, instead of allocating them in advance as it is
done in island architectures.

The first exploration of the facilities for concurrent programming
Perl 6 uses has been done through the auto-threading mechanism that
allows the parallel execution of code on arrays or lists. After making
small changes, this resulted in a speedup of the program in a number
that is compatible with the number of threads used by default, four.

However, a change to a concurrent architecture implies looking at an
algorithm in a different, non sequential way, 
that is why the first thing that has to be evaluated is the actual
number of evaluations that need to be done to solve the problem, since
the new implementation is not functionally equivalent to the old one. This
is what we have done in this paper. We have proposed two different
concurrent implementations of an evolutionary algorithms with different
{\em grain}: a {\em fine-grained} one that acts at the individual
level, and a {\em coarse-grained} one that acts at the level of populations.

The individual-level concurrent EA shows a good scaling across problem
size; besides, when comparing it with the population-level concurrent
EA and the canonical and sequential evolutionary algorithm, it obtains
a much better performance, being able to obtain the solution with a
much lower evaluation budget. Second best is the population-level
concurrent algorithm, to be followed by the baseline canonical EA,
which obtains the worse result. This proves that, even from the purely
algorithmic point of view, concurrent evolutionary algorithms are
better than sequential algorithms. If we consider time, the difference
increases, since the only sequential part of the concurrent algorithms
is reading from the channels, but once reading has been done the rest
of the operations can be performed concurrently, not to mention every
function can have as many copies as needed running in different
threads.

These results are not so much inherent to the concurrency itself as
dependent on the selection operators that have been included in the
concurrent version of the algorithms. The selection pressure of the
canonical algorithm is relatively low, depending on the roulette wheel
selection algorithm, as opposed to the more greedy operation of the
individual-level algorith, which uses tournament selection. The
population-level concurrent algorithm eliminates half the population
with the worst fitness, although every generation it is running a
canonical EA identical to the baseline; however, this exerts a high
selective pressure on the population which, combined with the
increased diversity of running two populations in parallel, results in
better performance. Same happens with the individual-level concurrent EA:
the worst of three is always eliminated, which exerts a big pressure
on the population, which is thus able to find the solution much
faster. Nothing prevents us from using these same mechanisms in an
evolutionary algorithm, which would then be functionally equivalent to
these concurrent algorithms, but we wanted to compare a canonical EA
to {\em canonical} concurrent evolutionary algorithms, at the same
time we compare different versions of them; in this sense, it is
better to use this individual-level concurrent algorithm in future
versions of the evolutionary algorithm library.

The main conclusion of this paper is that evolutionary algorithms can
benefit from concurrent implementations, and that these should be as
fine grained as possible. However, a lot of work remains to be
done. One line of research will be to try and use the implicitly
concurrent capabilities of Perl 6 to perform multi-threaded evaluation
or any other part of the algorithm, which would delegate the use of
the threading facilities to the compiler and virtual machine. That
will have no implications on the number of evaluations, but will help
make the overall application faster.

Of course, time comparisons will also have to be made, as well as a
more thorough exploration of the parameter space of the
population-level evolutionary algorithm. Since this type of algorithm
has a lower overhead, communicating via channels with lower frequency,
it could be faster than the individual-level concurrent EA. Measuring
the scaling with the number of thread is also an interesting line to
pursue; since our architecture is using single channels, this might
eventually be a bottleneck, and will prevent scaling to an indefinite
number of threads. However, that number might be higher than the
available number of threads in a desktop processor, so it has to be
measured in practice.

This paper has been intended mainly as a proof of concept, and thus
does not really focuses on creating a scalable architecture for
concurrent evolutionary algorithms. Preliminary results with the
individual-level concurrency indicate that a basic redesign is
probably needed to achieve good scaling performance. One of the
problems with this architecture is that actually every thread is doing
much less work than communication; since the application is
communication-bound it will get worse as the number of threads
increases. While keeping functional equivalence, it is probably better
to work with bigger batch sizes instead of working with a single
individual. 

Finally, we would like to remark that this paper is part of the open
science effort by the authors. It is hosted in GitHub, and the paper
repository hosts the data and scripts used to process them, which are
in fact embedded in this paper source code using Knitr \cite{xie2013knitr}.
