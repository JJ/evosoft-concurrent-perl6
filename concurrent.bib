abstract="This study describes an alternative concurrency approach in genetic algorithms. Inspiring from implicit parallelism in a physical chromosome, a vertical concurrency is introduced. Proposed gene process model allows genetic algorithms work in encodings independent from the gene position ordering in a chromosome. This feature is used to implement a gene reordering version of genetic algorithm. Further possible models of flexible gene position encodings are discussed.",

	These features include the different metaheuristic techniques covered,
	mechanisms for solution encoding, constraint handling, neighborhood
	specification, hybridization, parallel and distributed computation,
	software engineering best practices, documentation and user interface,
	etc. A metric has been defined for each feature so that the scores
	obtained by a framework are averaged within each group of features;
	leading to a final average score for each framework. Out of thirty
	three frameworks ten have been selected from the literature using
	well-defined filtering criteria, and the results of the comparison
	are analyzed with the aim of identifying improvement areas and gaps
	in specific frameworks and the whole set. Generally speaking, a significant
	lack of support has been found for hyper-heuristics, and par- allel
	and distributed computing capabilities. It is also desirable to have
	a wider implementation of some Software Engineering best practices.
	Finally, a wider sup- port for some metaheuristics and hybridization
	capabilities is needed.},

abstract="Evolutionary multi-agent systems (EMAS) play a critical role in many artificial intelligence applications that are in use today. In this paper, we present a new generic skeleton in Erlang for parallel EMAS computations. The skeleton enables us to capture a wide variety of concrete evolutionary computations that can exploit the same underlying parallel implementation. We demonstrate the use of our skeleton on two different evolutionary computing applications: (1) computing the minimum of the Rastrigin function; and (2) solving an urban traffic optimisation problem. We show that we can obtain very good speedups (up to 142.44                                                                          {\$}{\$}{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}                                                            {\texttimes}                                                       the sequential performance) on a variety of different parallel hardware, while requiring very little parallelisation effort.",
